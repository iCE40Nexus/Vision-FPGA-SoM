# FPGA Sample code
The designs are coded up in Verilog or System Verilog. Bitfiles and other code is provided as needed for the particular design. Place and route is done usually with the Lattice Radiant software but will work with the Open Source icestorm toolchain.

Note that the SensAI examples depend on the Lattice toolchain and the existence of a valid SensAI license which can be obtained from the Lattice website.

## Blink LED
This design implements a simple blinking LED as proof of life. It can be used to build more detailed applications.

## Pixart image sensor
This design implements the interface to the Pixart sensor and allows users to view images on a PC using TBD application.

## IMU
This design reports raw IMU values.

## Microphone
This design captures TBD samples and transfers the data over to the PC over the SPI port.

## SensAI
### Face detection
### Gesture detection
